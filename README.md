# Animals classification
This classification task is based on the https://www.kaggle.com/sharansmenon/animals141 kaggle dataset.
The goal was to reach 80% accuracy on the test set. I achived over 88% of accuracy on the test set using a transfer learning. The model was overfiting. I tried to use some regularization methods but without any good results.
